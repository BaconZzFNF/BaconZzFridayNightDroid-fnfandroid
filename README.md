Build instructions
first of all we need to set up haxe and haxeflixel read more here - https://github.com/ninjamuffin99/Funkin
Install haxe 4.2.2 instead of 4.1.5
if you updated it dont forget execute this command 'haxelib upgrade' and press 'y' everywhere
Also get extension-webm using this command: 'haxelib git extension-webm https://github.com/KlavierGayming/extension-webm'
the reason we use a different repo again is cuz of a lil error that happens with the audio sync, just adds a "public var renderedFrames" instead of "var renderedFrames", that's all extra that's needed
after that, download Android studio, Jdk, Ndk revision 15c from these sites
jdk - https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html

android studio - https://developer.android.com/studio

ndk - https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads/older_releases?hl=fi

3.install jdk, android studio

unzip ndk (ndk does not need to be installed)
we need to set up android studio for this go to android studio and find android sdk (in settings -> Appearance & Behavior -> system settings -> android sdk) andr andr2
5.and run command lime setup android

you need to insert the program paths

as in this picture (use jdk, not jre) lime

Now do "lime rebuild extension-webm windows" (in the command line), if you're planning to build for windows. If you're plannin to build for android (which you obviously are), use "lime rebuild extension-webm android". If you get an error, download this and put the folder inside it in C:/HaxeToolkit/haxe/lib/extension-webm/git/ndll

open project in command line cd (path to fnf source)
and run command lime build android -final
apk will be generated in this path (path to source)\export\release\android\bin\app\build\outputs\apk\debug\Funkin-debug.apk
